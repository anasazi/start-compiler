To build the source, you need GHC and Parsec at minimum.
If you use the Haskell Platform, then you have everything necessary.
Run ./build to build the source and produce ./dominators.

./dominators reads in a .start file from STDIN and dumps the output to STDOUT.
I keep the examples in IR form, so I normally use it like this: ./dominators <example.start
If you keep the examples in Start form, you can just pipe it together with the start compiler:
dart bin/start.dart -c examples/link.dart | ./dominators

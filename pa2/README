Well, I'm out of time and late days, so here's my code as is.
Currently it supports going in and out of SSA and making the return trip preserves behavior (the one exception is the primes example).
I tried to implement the Sparse Conditional Constant algorithm, but it seems to be having trouble.
I did not get to implement value numbering.

The ./build script should build the compiler and name it ./main. If you have the Haskell Platform installed, then you should be fine.
You can run the compiler with the requested options from ./main (i.e. ./main -opt=ssa -backend=ir).
Currently only supported options are: opt={ssa,scp} and backend:{ir,cfg,ssa}.
